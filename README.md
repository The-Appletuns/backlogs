Welcome to VGBackLogs.com! This is a social platform where users can gather, display, and share their game catalogs across multiple platforms.
Using a React.js front-end with a C# DotNET back-end connected to MongoDB, the platform is deployed through AWS to offer users a website to share their game collections with others.
